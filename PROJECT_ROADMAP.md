# Qlik Sense to Python BI Migration - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Replace Qlik Sense with a Python-based BI stack for 170M+ data rows (growing to 500M+)
**Current Status**: Planning phase
**Timeline**: 12 weeks
**Team Size**: Small team (couple dozen users max)
**Budget Priority**: Cost minimization

## Current Situation
- **Data Volume**: 170M rows (growing to 500M+)
- **Data Format**: CSV files (monthly updates)
- **Current Tool**: Qlik Sense
- **Users**: 20-30 concurrent users
- **Performance Requirement**: 2-3 second response times acceptable
- **Data Updates**: Monthly batch updates
- **Python Experience**: Team is very comfortable with Python

## Target Architecture

### Tech Stack (Phase 1)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas + DuckDB
- **Data Storage**: Parquet files + DuckDB (analytical queries)
- **Metadata Storage**: SQLite (user management, configurations)
- **API**: FastAPI
- **Caching**: File-based JSON caching
- **Frontend**: Streamlit + Plotly
- **Deployment**: Local first, AWS migration later

### Future Additions (Phase 2+)
- **Dask**: When memory limits are reached or parallel processing needed
- **Redis**: When faster caching or real-time features needed
- **PostgreSQL**: If complex relational data requirements emerge

## Data Migration Strategy

### Primary Approach: Qlik Sense API/QVD Export
1. **QRS API Integration**: Extract data models, relationships, and KPI definitions
2. **QVD File Export**: Export data in QVD format for efficient migration
3. **Data Model Analysis**: Parse load scripts to understand transformations
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Document table associations and joins

### Fallback Approach: Manual CSV + Documentation
1. **CSV Export**: Export data from Qlik Sense visualizations
2. **Manual Documentation**: Document data models and relationships
3. **Schema Reconstruction**: Rebuild data model in Python

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Qlik Sense → QVD/CSV Export → Pandas → Parquet → DuckDB → FastAPI → Streamlit
                ↓
        Data Model Analysis → SQLite (Metadata) → User Management
                ↓
        KPI Definitions → File Cache → Pre-calculated Results
```

### Key Components

#### Data Migration (`qlik_extractor.py`)

- QVD file processing and conversion
- Data model analysis and relationship mapping
- KPI definition extraction and replication

#### Data Processing (`data_processor.py`)
